dsCir_seq.py pipeline is stemmed from circleseq.py based on a published paper - 
CIRCLE-seq: A highly sensitive in vitro screen for genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 
nuclease off-targets, whose github address is "https://github.com/tsailabSJ/circleseq".

However, original circleseq pipeline would merge pair-end reads into one, then 
being aligned to reference. This dsCir-Seq extracts aligned result from the 
mapping result of pair-end reads, and judges the direction of library DNA whether
 it is circular or linear according to its mapping location.

Some steps in circleseq pipeline have been simplified and modified.

There is no need to delete all generated files and folders when you encountered some 
errors in your program. Deleting the files in the problematic step and run this pipeline 
again to re-analyze your data.

Procedure of dsCir_seq:
01. reads QC using fastp
02. align pair-end reads to reference using BWA
03. extract mapping information and generate report
04. summarize sequencing depth and uniformity
05. report

User must offer the two following file with requested format:
#1: sample.txt (seven columns separated by tab-delimited)
column 1: sample name
column 2: absolute path of read 1
column 3: absolute path of read 2
column 4: target site
column 5: chromosome
column 6: start
column 7: end

#2: adapter.fa (contains all adapter sequences with Fasta format)
>adapter_1
ATGCG...
>adapter_2
ACGTT...
>adapter_3
AGGTT...
